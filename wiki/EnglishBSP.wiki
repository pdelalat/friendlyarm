#summary An english BSP for the mini2440 is available

Errol has generated a Windows CE 6.0 BSP by putting together some updates, fixes from the forum ([http://www.friendlyarm.net/forum/topic/682 topic]) and parameters that seem to be useful for the most of us. This BSP can be downloaded in the *Downloads* section. 

=== Details ===
*Fixed:*
 * Network crash fix.
 * Multi CPU compile issue with SD driver. I hope. Couldn't test in Virtual Machine.

*Changed:*
 * Auto launch of touch screen calibration after first boot.
 * English language.
 * Network set to DHCP

*Removed:*
 * Chinese fonts

*Added:*
 * USB Remote NDIS Class driver (needed for Activesync)

 * Clock Synchronization registry entry, if SNTP client is included.
 * User Manager control panel applet by domdom, if FTP server or Telnet server or Webserver is included in the image.

WARNING: back up any old MINI2440 folders in PLATFORM or OSDesigns, as this will overwrite it.
